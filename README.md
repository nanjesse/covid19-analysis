***Comprehensive Analysis of Global COVID-19 Data: Trends, Insights, and Implications***

**Overview**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 data with a specific focus on African countries, particularly Nigeria. Various metrics such as total confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, active cases, and weekly changes were analyzed using data visualization, descriptive statistics, and correlations. Insights into the global spread and the impact of the pandemic on specific regions are explored.

The code and visualizations were developed to uncover trends, highlight regional differences, and assess the response to the pandemic across different countries.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from Kaggle and includes the following columns:

Country/Region: The name of the country or region.
Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, Active: Cumulative counts of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases.
New cases, New deaths, New recovered: Daily counts of new cases, deaths, and recoveries.
Deaths / 100 Cases, Recovered / 100 Cases, Deaths / 100 Recovered: Relative rates of deaths and recoveries.
Confirmed last week, 1-week change, 1-week increase (%): Weekly progression of cases.
WHO Region: World Health Organization region classification.
Key Features of the Analysis

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Top 10 Countries by Confirmed Cases: Visualizes the countries with the highest confirmed cases.
Top 10 Countries by Active Cases: Highlights the countries most impacted by active COVID-19 cases.
Deaths Distribution by WHO Region: Analyzes how fatalities are spread across different WHO regions.
Percentage of Global Cases by Country: Breaks down the contribution of each country to global cases.
Top 10 Countries by Weekly Growth: Identifies surging countries based on recent weekly growth.
Top 10 African Countries by Confirmed Cases: Focus on Africa, with South Africa leading in confirmed cases.
Nigeria-Specific Analysis:
COVID-19 Distribution in Nigeria: A pie chart visualizing confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases in Nigeria.
Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Recovery Rate: Metrics to measure the impact and effectiveness of Nigeria’s pandemic response.
Weekly Growth Rate: Tracks the change in confirmed cases week-over-week in Nigeria.
Calculations


**Technologies Used**

Python: Core programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib: For creating detailed visualizations and charts.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment to write code and create this analysis.
How to Run the Project


**The analysis produced a variety of insights including**

The United States, Brazil, and India account for a large share of global confirmed cases and deaths.
South Africa, Egypt, and Nigeria are among the African countries most impacted by COVID-19.
In Nigeria, the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is relatively low at 2.09%, while the Recovery Rate stands at 44.20%. However, the weekly growth rate of 10.62% shows that the pandemic is still spreading in the country.
The distribution of deaths across WHO regions shows significant variation likely due to differences in healthcare capacity and response strategies.
